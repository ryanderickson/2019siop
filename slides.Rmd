```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Wait, what's wrong with data now?

A lot.

```{r, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("bingo.png")

```


## Tech stack

1. **R** ~ the processor
2. **RStudio** ~ the OS
3. **Packages** ~ the programs




# Why R

## Capability

R...

* is almost always more capable than Excel, SAS, SPSS 
* incorporates new developments sooner
* can be general-purpose
* integrates well with other common languages




##

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, results="asis"}

library(plotly)
plot_ly(economics, x = ~date, y = ~unemploy / pop)

```


## Quality of life

R...

* creates one workflow from cleaning to presentation
* eleminates final.out, FINAL.out, OMGFINAL.out, etc.
* ensures everything is current via piping
* is (subjectively) easier to learn than SAS or SPSS syntax
* handles tedium for you



## Portability

R...

* is free & open source!

<br><br>

But can I really trust it if it's free?

```{r, out.width="95%"}

knitr::include_graphics("logos.png")

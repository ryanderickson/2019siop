# Modern Data Dashboards that Make a Difference

### About us

We're a data scientist (**Ryan Derickson**) and a psychologist (**Jena Wierwille**) for the National Center for Organization Development (NCOD), which is an internal OD consultant to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Ryan earned his MA in I-O from Xavier University, and is (slowly) finishing his quant PhD at the University of Cincinnati, and Jena earned her PsyD from Indiana State University. 

Most of our work at NCOD has focused on VA's annual All Employee Survey (AES). The AES has around 65 organizational health questions, is offered to all VA employees, and usually has over a 60% response rate. All of VA is mapped down to the workgroup level (small teams of 5-50 people). NCOD is responsible for getting that data back out to the system and helping everyone in VA use it to drive positive change.  

Historically, we used giant PowerPoints, PDFs, and data cubes to get everyone their data (we didn't have much choice, NCOD is a small office and VA has almost 400,000 employees). We consistently got feedback that people loved the data but hated the presentation methods - most people just didn't have the time or patience to put the pieces together themselves or to wade through oceans of data to find what they needed. 

In 2017, we scrapped most of what wasn't working well and replaced it with the AES Dashboard. It's built on the ```flexdashboard``` platform and makes it easy for everyone in VA to get the data they need **and** integrated tools that help everyone use the data most effectively given their role. We expanded the dashboard to include an executive briefing space in 2018. Since introducing the dashboard, we've seen significant increases in the number of people who say their groups are using the data to improve.

- **Students** - super marketable & differentiating skillset  
- **Academics** - powerful teaching and collaboration tools  
- **Professionals** - wow your clients

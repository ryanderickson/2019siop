# Modern Data Dashboards that Make a Difference

### About us

We're a data scientist (**Ryan Derickson**) and a psychologist (**Jena Wierwille**) for the National Center for Organization Development (NCOD), which is an internal OD consultant to the Dept. of Veterans Affairs.  We took a hard look in the mirror a few years ago and realized most of the products we created were to boring, dense, and ineffective. We thought there had to be a way to make data, analyses, etc. **engaging** and **responsive**.

# Modern Data Dashboards that Make a Difference

### About us

We're a data scientist (**Ryan Derickson**) and a psychologist (**Jena Wierwille**) for the National Center for Organization Development (NCOD), which is an internal OD consultant to the Dept. of Veterans Affairs.  blah blah blah





### Who this is for

These tools and methods are perfect for scientists, academics, consultants, or students. Hopefully you're at least a little familiar with R, but it's ok if you're not. Nowadays, it just takes a little bit of code to make really cool stuff.





### What we'll cover

1. **Best practices for data presentation**
    + Data visualizations
    + Supporting materials

2. **Brief intro to R and friends**
    + R
    + RStudio
    + RMarkdown

3. **flexdashboard**
    + Static HTML

4. **shinydashbaord**
    + Cloud
    


### What we do




### How to do it (and the sales pitch for switching to R)

Here's the tech stack you need (it's all free and open source):

1. **R**  
    + R is a programming language and its speciality is data analysis and data visualization. If you use Excel, SAS or SPSS now, there are many benefits to R and we encourage you to give it a shot. There's a little bit of a learning curve but it's worth it.  
    + R is like the processor in your computer. 
    
2. **RStudio**  
    + RStudio is the best development environment for R. It makes it a lot easier to write R code and provides a lot of built in functions so you don't need to write as much code to begin with.  
    + RStudio is like the operating system.  
    
3. **Packages**  
    + R is a whole ecosystem is packages that do specilized things. You call the packages you need to do the things you want to do.   
    + Packages are like specific programs.

Here are a few benefits of working in this environment:

1. **You get to make cool stuff not possible with other programs!**
    + R/RStudio/Packages handle a lot of the tedium for you so you can focus on the fun stuff.
    
2. **Your quality of life will improve dramatically!**
    + Code is documentation - you'll always be able to go back and see what you've done
    + Your data cleaning, analysis, and visualization are in the same workflow! No more pasting results across programs or wondering whether you remembered to rerun your model. Everything is together and you know it's current. 
    + No more folders full of files like Final.out, Final1.out, FINAL.out, OMGFINAL.out, etc.
    
3. **You'll become much more efficient!**
    + Automation is your friend.
